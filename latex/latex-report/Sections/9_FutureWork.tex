The \cw{LogisticRegression} class should be extended to include other optimization methods, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent and Mini-batch Gradient Descent. As became evident from our logistic regression analysis, standard Gradient Descent and Newton-Raphson's method are slow to use on large training instances. Both Stochastic Gradient Descent and Mini-Batch Gradient Descent should perform better on these cases.
